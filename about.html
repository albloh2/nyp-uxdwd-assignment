                    <p>The NYP E-Sports CCA started in 2021 with a simple idea: to bring students together through competitive gaming.
                        What began as a small group of friends playing Valorant has evolved into a thriving community.
                        We now compete in major leagues like <span class="text-nowrap">Campus Legends Singapore</span> and have a reputation for teamwork, sportsmanship, and success.
                        Our club is more than just gaming; it's about building friendships, developing skills, and representing NYP with pride.</p>
